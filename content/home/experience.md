      * Amazon Q Developer, Kiro, and CodeWhisperer; LLMs for Coding. 
      * 2025: Post-training, reinforcement learning of LLM foundation models, agentic AI, reasoning: Designed and implemented the multi-turn agentic RL recipe, enabling tool-integrated and reasoning across Amazon’s Nova and Kiro models. Kiro, an agentic coding integrated development environment that brings clarity through spec-driven development, with more than 100,000+ developers jumping in during the first days of preview and more than doubling since.
      * 2024: Our project, Amazon Q Developer code review, is announced by AWS CEO Matt Garman at AWS re:Invent 2024. Designed the core functionality of the code review agent. The product achieved 85% precision in offline evaluation, and is now used by 10K+ developers, and flagged 1M+ issues in its first quarter.

      * Designed a safe and scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning  framework for the behavior planning and control of connected autonomous vehicles to improve traffic efficiency and safety.
      * Proposed a stable and efficient reward reallocation algorithm to motivate cooperation for multi-agent reinforcement learning assuming all agents are self-interested.
      * Studied the fundamental properties of the robust multi-agent reinforcement learning under adversarial state perturbations and proposed a new objective and an algorithm to learn robust policy.
