    description: |2-
        
        * Design an algorithm to exploit the advantages raised by the extended sensing capability of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) through beneficial information sharing.
        * Analyze quantum key distribution protocols through a game theoretic framework to show improved noise tolerance and secure communication rate assuming adversaries are “rational”.
        * Design a feedback deep Q-learning algorithm for a hybrid system to explore a policy for discrete state transitions while ensuring the safety of both discrete and continuous dynamics in training.
        * Design an integrated information sharing and feedback DRL framework for the behavior planning of connected autonomous vehicles to improve traffic efficiency and safety.
        * Design an algorithm to solve the mixed objective robust multi-agent RL problem to alleviate the non-stationary environment considering an uncertainty set of training partners’ policy uncertainty.

    description: |2-
        
        * Design a flexible energy management approach to handle the uncertainties of weather and sizing in an isolated microgrid, which would not be influenced dramatically by different weather conditions.
        * Design and fabricate high efficient bidirectional DC/DC converters to conduct and validate energy management approaches in a downsized system.
        * Build a hardware testbed to study reconfigurable energy systems.
