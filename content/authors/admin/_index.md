I am a research scientist at Sony AI. I got my Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering working on artificial intelligence supervised by Prof. [Fei Miao](http://feimiao.org) at the University of Connecticut. I was working on game theoretic energy management approaches in [Dynamic Systems Control Lab](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/) at the University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute supervised by Prof. [Chengbin Ma](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/professor/). 

My current research interests include artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, machine learning, autonomous driving, computer vision, and game theory.
