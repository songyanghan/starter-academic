I am an Applied Scientist at [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) AI Labs, where I work on the post-training of agentic foundation models based on large language models (LLMs). Prior to Amazon, I worked at [Sony AI America](https://ai.sony) with [Prof. Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/) and [Peter Wurman](https://www.pwurman.org) on developing a superhuman racing agent [Gran Turismo Sophy](https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gran-turismo-sophy/) for a highly realistic racing game.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Connecticut, where I was advised by [Prof. Fei Miao](http://feimiao.org) and focused on artificial intelligence. Before that, I worked on game theory in the [Dynamic Systems Control Lab](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/) advised by [Prof. Chengbin Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/chbma17/home) at the [University of Michiganâ€“Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn).  I received my B.E. degree from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/).

My current research interests include large language models, artificial general intelligence, reinforcement learning, and generative AI.
