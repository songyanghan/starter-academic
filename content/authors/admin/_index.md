I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in computer science and engineering working on artificial intelligence supervised by Prof. [Fei Miao](http://feimiao.org) at University of Connecticut. I was working on game theoretic energy management approaches in [Dynamic Systems Control Lab](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/) in University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute supervised by Prof. [Chengbin Ma](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/dsc/professor/). 

My current research interests include robust and scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, autonomous driving, computer vision, and game theory.

## News
* [2022/5] Our paper "Stable and Efficient Shapley Value-Based Reward Reallocation for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning of Autonomous Vehicles" is presented on the 2022 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Philadelphia, USA, May 2022. 
* [2022/3] I get the second place award in the 8th annual graduate poster competition hosted by the School of Engineering of University of Connecticut. I also get the first place award in the Computer Science and Engineering Department.
* [2022/3] Our paper "DeResolver: A Decentralized Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Framework for Smart City Services" is accepted by ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems.
