Gran Turismo Sophy (GT Sophy) is a revolutionary superhuman racing agent developed through the collaboration between Sony AI, Polyphony Digital (PDI), and Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE). The agent was designed to compete against top Gran Turismo® Sport drivers and elevate their gaming experience.

GT Sophy was trained using novel deep reinforcement learning techniques, including state-of-the-art learning algorithms and training scenarios developed by Sony AI, using Gran Turismo Sport, a real driving simulator, and by leveraging SIE’s cloud gaming infrastructure for massive scale training.
