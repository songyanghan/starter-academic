abstract: "We propose a novel hybrid system behavior planning method for
  connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to utilize shared information to decide
  actions such as whether to change lane or keep lane, and to make sure that
  there exist corresponding control maneuvers such as acceleration and steering
  angle to guarantee safety. We formulate this problem as a hybrid system
  partially observable Markov decision process to consider objectives such as
  improving traffic flow efficiency, driving comfort and safety requirements.
  The feedback deep Q-learning algorithm we design aims to solve the critical
  challenge of reinforcement learning (RL) for a hybrid system model:
  guaranteeing the safety of the dynamic system while the RL is exploring the
  action space to increase the reward. We prove that our method renders a
  forward invariant safe set for the continuous state space physical system
  dynamic model while the RL agent is learning in discrete action space. In
  experiments, our behavior planning method can increase traffic flow and
  driving comfort of CAVs compared with the literature. We also validate that
  our method maintains safety during the learning process."
