abstract: "The recent advancements in wireless technology enable connected
  autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to gather information about their environment by
  vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. In this work, we design an
  information-sharing-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework
  for CAVs, to take advantage of the extra information when making decisions to
  improve traffic efficiency and safety. The safe actor-critic algorithm we
  propose has two new techniques: the truncated Q-function and safe action
  mapping. The truncated Q-function utilizes the shared information from
  neighboring CAVs such that the joint state and action spaces of the Q-function
  do not grow in our algorithm for a large-scale CAV system. We prove the bound
  of the approximation error between the truncated-Q and global Q-functions. The
  safe action mapping provides a provable safety guarantee for both the training
  and execution based on control barrier functions. Using the CARLA simulator
  for experiments, we show that our approach can improve the CAV system's
  efficiency in terms of average velocity and comfort under different CAV ratios
  and different traffic densities. We also show that our approach avoids the
  execution of unsafe actions and always maintains a safe distance from other
  vehicles. We construct an obstacle-at-corner scenario to show that the shared
  vision can help CAVs to observe obstacles earlier and take action to avoid
  traffic jams."
