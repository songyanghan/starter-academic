abstract: "As various smart services are increasingly deployed in modern cities,
  many unexpected conflicts arise due to various physical world couplings.
  Existing solutions for conflict resolution often rely on centralized control
  to enforce predetermined and fixed priorities of different services, which is
  challenging due to the inconsistent and private objectives of the services.
  Also, the centralized solutions miss opportunities to more effectively resolve
  conflicts according to their spatiotemporal locality of the conflicts. To
  address this issue, we design a decentralized negotiation and conflict
  resolution framework named DeResolver, which allows services to resolve
  conflicts by communicating and negotiating with each other to reach a
  Pareto-optimal agreement autonomously and efficiently. Our design features a
  two-level semi-supervised learning-based algorithm to predict acceptable
  proposals and their rankings of each opponent through the negotiation. Our
  design is evaluated with a smart city case study of three services:
  intelligent traffic light control, pedestrian service, and environmental
  control. In this case study, a data-driven evaluation is conducted using a
  large data set consisting of the GPS locations of 246 surveillance cameras and
  an automatic traffic monitoring system with more than 3 million records per
  day to extract real-world vehicle routes. The evaluation results show that our
  solution achieves much more balanced results, i.e., only increasing the
  average waiting time of vehicles, the measurement metric of intelligent
  traffic light control service, by 6.8% while reducing the weighted sum of air
  pollutant emission, measured for environment control service, by 12.1%, and
  the pedestrian waiting time, the measurement metric of pedestrian service, by
  33.1%, compared to priority-based solution."
